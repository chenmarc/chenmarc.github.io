    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
	My name is Marc Chenard, and I am a Computer Scientist with interests in security and AI. I am forward-thinking, practiced in leveraging AI tools, while also striving to internalize the fundamentals and history of the field.
	
	I recently obtained my Master’s in Computer Science at Portland State University on the Security track, and also completed the graduate cybersecurity certificate. Prior to that, I earned my undergraduate degree at PSU's Honors College in Biology, with a minor in Neuroscience.
	
	Throughout my journey, starting in natural science and moving into leveling up my technical skills, I have been lucky enough to work for organizations whose missions align with my values.

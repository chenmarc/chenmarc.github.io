                    <p>My name is Marc Chenard, and I'm a computer scientist who specializes in cybersecurity and AI.</p>
		    <p><br></p>
		    <p>I recently completed my master's in computer science on the security track at Portland State University, also earning a graduate cybersecurity certificate. Before that, I earned my undergraduate degree in biology from PSU's Honors College, minoring in neuroscience.</p>
		    <p><br></p>
		    <p>Shifting from the natural sciences to honing my technical skills, I’ve had the chance to work for organizations that align with my values, applying my interdisciplinary background to technical projects that aim to improve health outcomes and advance other meaningful causes. </p>

                            <p>I joined an interdisciplinary team of clinical and technical interns to research how AI and vocal biomarkers might help screen and diagnose disease. I learned about the physiology of voice production, machine-learning algorithms suited for acoustic signals and speech, and explored ethical questions that emerge where AI meets health data.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>I collaborated with team members with backgrounds in general surgery, public health, computer science, and biomedical informatics. I contributed to a Python codebase built with pandas, scikit-learn, and a suite of audio processing tools. I also competed in my first hackathon in Tampa, taking on AI challenges alongside interns from OHSU, Cornell, Washington University, and the University of South Florida. My hackathon team's work spun off into an independent research project exploring what baseline voice might look like in the domain of mood disorder prediction.</p>
